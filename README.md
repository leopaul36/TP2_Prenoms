# TP2: MapReduce on prenoms.csv

- Count first name by origin in `NameByOrigin.java`
- Count number of first name by number of origin in `FirstNameByNumber`
-  Proportion (in%) of male or female

I could not manage to achieve the third questions despite my numerous attempts.

Please check `Proportion.java` and `Proportion2.java` for details on my reflexions.
